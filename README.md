# Master thesis

This repository contains code of simulations and experiments, as well as additional results and figures, for the master thesis:
'Feature Attribution Methods: Shapley Values on Logical Formulas and Improving Explanations by Averaging'. 

E2 and E3 require the ImageNet2012-dataset. 
To replicate the results of E2 an extensive training of models is necessary.
