# Master thesis

This repository contains code of simulations and experiments conducted for the master thesis:
'Feature Attribution Methods: Shapley Values on Logical Formulas and Improving Explanations by Averaging'. 

For Experiment 2 E2_ducks-in-imagenet, to replicate results an extensive training of models is necessary,
but some results are given.
